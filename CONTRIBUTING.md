# Contributing to SynEpis

SynEpis is in the first instance a philosophical project intending to articulate some ideas about the representation of knowledge which are philosophical in character.
As such the kinds of contributions I would welcome are primarily those which might help me to present the ideas in an intelligible way, or which identify weaknesses in the ideas or their presentation.

It is my aim to make the materials accessible to as broad a range of audiences as possible by making them clearto AI chatbots, targetting Grok in the first instance, and the publishing with the suggestion that readers supply the text to Grok (or their preferred AI) and resolving matters which are not clear to them by discussion with the AI.
Likely I will also seek AI help in adapting the materials for other media or channels.

For that reason, my early work, particularly that on the intruductory chapter, will probably involve contrubutions only from AIs, probably mostly Grok, and the way that works remains fluid, documented in the appendices to the draft pdf containing Chapter 1 of the main text (part1.pdf).

The remainder of this note anticipates in a small way kinds of contributions from people which will be welcomed once a draft of that first chapter has been published.

## How to Contribute
- Read the file part1.pdf or any extract from them which has been distributed.
- Discuss with an AI (Grok suggested) any difficulties which you may find in understanding the material (this is an optional step, you can skip this step if you prefer)
- If problems remain, either of clarity or of substance, use the comments facilities in the medium you sourced the material for, or email me directly.  
- Beware, I am targetting Grok, so if your comments are about intelligibility for some other audience I may not be too responsive, unless it exposes gaps which Grok can't fill for them.

## Guidelines

## Notes
- This will evolve as the project grows. For now, itâ€™s a test of AI collaboration.
- I am now, with AI help, looking to make this epistemology into the first stage of a development project, passing through architectural and detailed design to code.
As that progresses entirely different kinds of contribution will be welcome and this document will be extended to cover them.
