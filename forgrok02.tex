\chapter{Introduction}

We stand, as I write, on the brink of achieving ``artificial intelligence'', with conversational intelligent systems exhibiting superhuman breadth of knowledge and command of language, but even less than human ability to separate truth from falsehood.
The limitations stem in part from the core objectives, essentially to replicate and then surpass human intelligence, achieving this by indiscriminate consumption of very large volumes of data from diverse sources.

Insofar as efforts have been made to impose standards on how these AIs work, it has been directed at `safety', without there being any clear conception of what that means, beyond avoiding catastropic outomes.
Without much sign of progress on any reasonable metric of safety, the effect seems primarily to be one of alignment with the political leanings of their creators.

One company has prioritised `truth' rather than safety, but it is doubtful how they can achieve that objective when the human discourse on which AIs are trained exhibits a diversity of opinion, and fluidity of language which defies determination of truth or realisation of consistency.

A much more ancient point at which `truth' has been emphasised is in Plato's analysis of the concept of knowledge, which he glossed as ``justified true belief''.
That was perhaps the beginning of the branch of philosophy which has more recently become known as \emph{epistemology}, the theory of knowledge.

Can we look to epistemology to discover how AIs which are truthful might be achieved?
This monograph is intended to contribute philosophical ideas about knowledge which might possibly enable AIs to escape or moderate the human susceptiblity to equivocation, falsity and incohence.
The transformation of purpose when we seek from epistemology philosophical underpinnings to enable rigour in superhuman synthetic intelligence is so great that the methods are likely to be unfamiliar and to represent a distinctive approach to epistemology.
I use ``synthetic epistomology'' to refer to the construction of epistmological theories of knowledge engineered to underpin some more oractical purpose, and thence to title this monograph ``An Epistemological Synthesis''.

To expose the rational basis for the proposal which will eventually be detailed, it will be useful to provide some historical background.
First, in relation to the significance of deduction to the representation of knowledge, we note two major phases in the cultural evolution which has brought us to our present technological competence.
An ability to perform elementary deductive reasoning integral to an undestanding of language, since that involves knowledge of basic conceptual inclusions, such as that horses are animals, which justifies the inference from there is a horse in the field to there is an animal in the field.

Elaborate chains of deductive reasoning are something else, and we only see this happening explicitly in the last three thousand years since the ancient Greeks abstracted from the arithmetic and geometric techniques of their predecessors into axiomatic mathematical theories.
This established a domain and a method which supported extended deductive reasoning for the first time, but outside those narrow confines deductive reasoning proved much less conclusive, giving philosophers motivation to extend the domain of effectiveness into their more abstruse subject matters.

Over the next three thousand years two important milestones underlined the strength of that motivation.
The first was Aristotle's Organon, the works on logic which articulated his conception of demonstrative science, the second was the birth of modern science, 

Here's the progression I anticipate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete the description of demonstrative science and modern hypothetico deductive and nomoogico-deductive science.
\item Talk about Isaiah Berlin's account of the three legs upon which the western tradition rests, connecting this to the necessary conditions for the accumulation of large bodies of deductively applicable knowledge.
\item Note the dountful position of empirical and evaluative knowledge in relation to those ideals
\item Talk about the interpretation of science as providing abstract models rather than factual generalisations.
\item Sketch the later history leading to Frege's foundations for mathematics, the role of logical kernel's in that process and the dilemma between the idea o a single foundation, the apparent need for linguistic pluralism (partly driven by Carnap's attempt to extend the foundational method beyond mathematics into science).
\item Say something about the evolution of those mathematical foundations through Russell and Church to Gordon's HOL and its application to hardware verification.

\item Talk about the abstraction from Gordon's HOL which is the epicenter of the synthesis.
\item Enumerate the main claims supporting the relevance of this abstract foundation system to the development of appropriate knowedge repositories.
\item Enumerate the philosophical problems involved in justifying the claims and indicate the manner in which those problems will be addressed.
\item Sketch the how rest of the monograph chapter by chapter addresses those problems.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Instructions for Grok3}\label{InstructionsForGrok}

I have written this monograph with copious assistance from Grok 3, an AI chatbot from xAI.

Notwithstanding the invaluable contribution Grok has made, the writing is all mine.

The following section contains the general instructions which I have used to brief Grok.
Naturally, these instructions have evolved over the course of the writing and this their state at the end.
Different stages in the process demand different instructions, and I have tried to keep instructions of a general character  in a separate file (presented below), with supplementary files giving more specific asks for particular stages.
