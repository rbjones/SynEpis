This monograph wraps an evolutionary tale around an epistemological synthesis.

The epistemological synthesis is built upon a logical core, first engineered for narrow mathematical purposes (though not without wider ambition), but is here re-purposed as a universal substrate for the representation of knowledge.
It is presented as \emph{foundational} in providing a primitive base for the largest of superstructures, and hence its advocacy is a variant of the much derided philosophical tendency to \emph{foundationalism}.
The philosophy constructed around it here may also be seen as a reversion to the ancient Aristotelian pursuit of \emph{first philosophy}, the idea that philosophy has a contribution to make which is in some sense prior to and more general than the sciences.
In this case, that the aggregation of a single shared body of coherent knowledge about the world we live in is a desirable end and demands an appropriate foundation for the representation of knowledge which is common to all the sciences (and beyond).

What has evolution to do with this?
There are two evolutionary stories which contribute to understanding the nature of the proposed logical foundations and the thesis I present about their importance for the future.

The first is the story which has lead to the emergence of the logical systems in question, which represent, I suggest, a kind of terminus beyond which further developments to such logical foundations are likely to be marginal (though we are just at the beginning of finding the best ways to build on these foundations).
This is a long story from which I present just those elements which are most signficant in leading to the supposed foundational terminus.

The second is a tale of how the future may unfold, and the evolutionary imperatives which will ensure that the identified foundational systems will become the dominant paradigm for rhe representation of knowledge.

This is not science, the principal ideas promoted here are not such as are susceptible to conclusive demonstration, and do not present clear opportunities for falsification.
Though this kind of criterion for solid scientific truth has an important place in science.
Life normally presents us with choices which have to be made on more tenuous grounds.
Engineers routinely work with models of the real world which are known to be adequate applicable approximations, such as the frameword of Newtonian physics now known to be false.
Philosophy probes beyond the uncertainties of everyday life into matters less easy to comprehend and susceptible to greater doubts.

The main substance of this monograph is offered as philosophical, as a contribution to epistemology.
That epistemology is conceived of as the the foundation of a broader philosophical system, which will be lightly sketched, and that potential is a part of its putative philosophical merit.
Though foundational in character, it is only possible to understand and articulate this system in the context of the evolutionary story which has lead to its core components, and the projection of that story into the future is an important motivator for the presentation of the system.

At its most portentous, that is the story of the evolution of intelligence, and will become the story of its proliferation through the cosmos, in consequence of an evolutionary imperative which defies stasis.
These exotic but speculative ideas have an important role to play in expounding and motivating the epistemological synthesis, but are colourful accessories to the primary purpose of this monograph which is philosophical.

\section{What is Knowledge?}

Epistemology is the theory of knowledge.
Later I will talk about some of the various kinds of epistemology in order to make clear the synthetic epistemology which I am attempting in this monograph, but for this introduction, doing a bit of synthetic epistmology by talking about knowledge will suffice.

In the broad conception of knowledge which concerns me here,\footnote{Which encompasses the whole of semiotics.} knowledge is a natural phenomenon in which one physical structure carries information about some other aspect of the real world.
Often the relationship is underpinned by a causal connetion between the representation and the structure represented which results in the state of the representation reflecting the state of the causing system and therefore conveying information to anyone observing the relationship who understands how that relationship works.

In some cases this causal relationship is very direct and obvious, for example in perception, when a causal chain from the perceived structure mediated by sense organs results in modifications to synaptic weights in the brain of the observer which represents information about the perceived structure.
If the perceiving person then writes an account of his experience, we have a very different representation of information about that structure, and a more complex and uncertain causal relationship between the two.
This kind of knowledge, in the brain, is known as `explicit', and its appearance in language as 'declarative'.
Declarative knowledge, knowing that, may be distinguished from procedural knowledge, knowing how.
Its representation, again in synaptic connections and weights, is a physical system which effects a useful behaviour in response to a suitable physical context, which result in some appropriate physical activity.
Even where our knowledge may be of how to accomplish some mental gymnastics, the result will at least have some physical representation in the brain, and most likely will be transcribed into some other physical medium.

Having emphasised the physical nature of both the represenatation of knowledge and its subject, I should aknowledge that, increasingly as human civilisation has advanced, important bodies of knowledge are most naturally seen as speaking about non-physical abstract matters.
This is a natural consequence of the pragmatics of generalisation, in which patterns applicable to many distinct physical situations are captured without reference to any specific instance of their applicable instances.
Naturally, when we, as epistemologists, talk about these phenomenon, the inevitable (desirable and intended) generalisations and abstraction, will tempt us into considering abstractions from the concrete representations and attribute the representation of knowledge to abstract forms.
Nothwithstanding that the representation and the subject will not allways be physical, it will be useful in this discussion to speak as they always are so that we can focus the following talk about abstractions on the relationship between representation and subject matter, which I will speak of as `semantics' however distant it might feel from linguistics.

Semantics is the relationship between knowledge and its subject matters, and the existence of some such relationship is the crucial condition for some physical structure to represent or constitute knowledge.

This concern with the representation of knowledge has not been central to most philosophy, which additional criteria about the fidelity of the representation and the grounds for belief in that fidelity (justification) have been central, and have lead to some philosophers regarding that those criteria can never be realised and that knowledge is therefore unattainable, and others to devote considerable time and energy to the refutation of scepticism.
This we may think of as a debate about a particularly fastidious conception of knowledge, while usage in the broad sweep of everyday contexts is much more accomodating.
In this context, the conception of knowledge as requiring not only faithful representation but conclusive evidence of that fidelity is a narrowing of the scope of knowledge which would be fatal to the kinds of evolutionary argument which I will in the course of this monograph advance for the future preponderance of informations systems built around the representations of knowledge which this epistemological synthesis advances.

It is now time to talk about semantics, the role of abstract ontolgy in precisely describing the semantic relationships between knowledge and its subject matter, and hence the role of abstract structures in the representation of knowledge.

\section{The Structure of this Monograph}

The epicenter of this epistemological synthesis is the idea of a quasi-universal logical foundation system, and the exposition has three principle aims:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To define and explain the term `quasi-universal foundation system'
\item To present a preferred quasi-universal foundation system, together with support for the claim that it is one.
\item To explain how such a system provides a basis for a distributed shared knowledge base which is suitable for use by an inteligence network expanding across the galaxy and beyond.
\item To motivate the proposed foundations through an account of their origin, and a projection of their role into the future, assessing their role in the light of the evolutionary imperatives which will govern which kinds of intelligent systems will predominate as transgalaxic proliferation progresses.
  \end{enumerate}
