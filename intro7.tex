This monograph makes an epistemological point in the context of a narrative about the evolution of intelligence.

The making of that point belongs to what I term \emph{synthetic epistemology}.
The point is, that a particular family of logical systems is a specially good, almost universal, representation system for knowledge, the general adoption of which would be advantageous, and may even be inevitable.
My \emph{making} of that point, beyond mere description of the system, falls into two main parts.

The first is a sketch of the foundational kernal of a \emph{philosophical system} which provides an approprate context in which to understand the rationale for the proffered foundation systems.
The \emph{synthesis} is an indivisible whole integrating metaphysics, language, logic and epistemology, motivated by the role it may play in the advancement of mathematics, science, technology and engineering and their use in the proliferation of intelligence. 

The second describes key aspects of that part of the evolution of intelligence which began here on Earth a few billion years ago, progressing through this present moment of supposed epistemoligical insight into a future in the progeny of earthly intelligent life spreads across the galaxy and beyond.
In this story, the past trajectory is intended to inform the readers understanding of how these logical systems arose and their nature, while the present and future trajectories say something about the significance of them in spreading intelligence across the galaxy.

There are two closely related divisions of the idea of knowledge which are important he
