This monograph makes an epistemological point in the context of a narrative about the evolution of intelligence.

The making of that point belongs to what I term \emph{synthetic epistemology}.
The point is, that a particular family of logical systems is a specially good, almost universal, representation system for knowledge, the general adoption of which would be advantageous, and may even be inevitable.
My \emph{making} of that point, beyond mere description of the system, falls into two main parts.

The first is a sketch of the foundational kernal of a \emph{philosophical system} which provides an approprate context in which to understand the rationale for the proffered foundation systems.
The \emph{synthesis} is an indivisible whole integrating metaphysics, language, logic and epistemology, motivated by the role it may play in the advancement of mathematics, science, technology and engineering and their use in the proliferation of intelligence. 

The second describes key aspects of that part of the evolution of intelligence which began here on Earth a few billion years ago, progressing through this present moment of supposed epistemoligical insight into a future in the progeny of earthly intelligent life spreads across the galaxy and beyond.
In this story, the past trajectory is intended to inform the readers understanding of how these logical systems arose and their nature, while the present and future trajectories say something about the significance of them in spreading intelligence across the galaxy.

There are two closely related divisions of the idea of knowledge which are important here.
The first is that between knowing \emph{that} and knowing how \emph{how}, and the distinction beween \emph{declarative} and \emph{procedural} knowledge.

The classical characterisation of knowledge as \emph{justified true belief}, relates most clearly to declarative knowledge, but the idea of procedural knowledge embraces a much broader range of phenomenon in which some kind of learning process yeilds subsequent behavoural advantage.
The kinds of knowledge which consist in true beliefs depend upon beliefs having \emph{truth conditions}, which we normally associate with meaningful notations, since the idea of truth conditions arose in the analysis of the meaning of declarative sentences.
So we might expect that declarative knowledge goes back only as far as declarative language, while procedural knowledge goes back as far as behavioural adaptation.
Behavioural adaptation goes back to some of the most primitive organisms, and beyond them is found in the process of biological evolution, which may be said to code into DNA its discoveries about which proteins are advantageous to each species in its own environmental niche.
